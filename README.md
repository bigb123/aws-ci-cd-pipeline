# aws-ci-cd-pipeline
AWS Cloudformation stack that prepares ci/cd pipeline using AWS tools: code pipeline, code commit and code deploy. It deploys itself and one more stack from second repository.

This file provides basic pipeline. It works but it's not finished in case of security. The pipeline permissions are probably too open.
